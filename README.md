# Resilient HTTP Client Starter

A Spring Boot starter that provides plug-and-play **resilience features** (Circuit Breaker, Retry, Rate Limiter) and rich **observability** for HTTP clients, powered by [Resilience4j](https://resilience4j.readme.io/) and [Micrometer](https://micrometer.io/).

Built to help developers quickly adopt production-grade, fault-tolerant client-side HTTP logic â€” with sensible defaults and deep integration into Springâ€™s `RestClient`.

## Features

- Declarative client configuration via `application.yml`
- Resilience4j-based:
    - Circuit Breaker
    - Retry
    - Rate Limiter
- Metrics & tracing via Micrometer `Observation`

A thread is created to monitor all the instances of CircuitBreakers to transition them to HALF_OPEN once waitDurationInOpenState passes. Whereas, if set to false the transition to HALF_OPEN only happens if a call is made, even after waitDurationInOpenState is passed. The advantage here is no thread monitors the state of all CircuitBreakers. |
