## Configuration

### HttpComponentsClientHttpRequestFactory

`HttpComponentsClientHttpRequestFactory` from Spring Framework acts as a bridge between Spring's `RestClient` and Apache
`HttpClient`

#### Timeout Settings in `HttpComponentsClientHttpRequestFactory`

| Method                                  | Purpose (with HttpClient Mapping)                                                                                                                                       | Default Value  | Rationale                                                                          | Usage                                                                     |
|-----------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `setConnectTimeout(Duration)`           | Time to establish a TCP connection to the target server. <br> Maps to `ConnectionConfig.setConnectTimeout` in Apache HttpClient 5 when building the connection manager. | `0` (infinite) | Prevents the client from hanging indefinitely when the target host is unreachable. | Set to 1â€“2 seconds to fail fast on unreachable or slow hosts.             |
| `setConnectionRequestTimeout(Duration)` | Time to wait for a connection from the connection pool. <br> Maps to `RequestConfig.setConnectionRequestTimeout` in Apache HttpClient 5.                                | `0` (infinite) | Avoids thread starvation when all pooled connections are in use.                   | Set to 500msâ€“1 second in high-concurrency environments to avoid blocking. |
| `setReadTimeout(Duration)`              | Time to wait for the full response after the request is sent. <br> Maps to `RequestConfig.setResponseTimeout` in Apache HttpClient 5.                                   | `0` (infinite) | Ensures the client doesn't hang waiting for a slow or unresponsive server.         | Set to 3â€“5 seconds depending on expected response time and SLA.           |

### Apache HttpClient5 Configurations

#### Request Configuration Parameters

These settings operate at the Request level to fine tune behaviour per request.

| Configuration                     | Purpose                                                                 | Default Value      | Rationale                                                                  | Usage                                                                    |
|-----------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **`setConnectionRequestTimeout`** | Time to wait for a connection from the connection pool.                 | 3 minutes          | Prevents threads from waiting indefinitely when the pool is exhausted.     | Important in high-load scenarios where pooled connections may be scarce. |
| **`setResponseTimeout`**          | Maximum time to wait for the entire response after the request is sent. | Not set (infinite) | Ensures the client doesn't hang waiting for a slow or unresponsive server. | Ideal for setting a hard timeout for the full request-response cycle.    |

#### Connection Configuration Parameters

These settings operate at the Connection management level, influencing the lifecycle of HTTP connections in the pool.

| Configuration                    | Purpose                                                                           | Default                                                           | Rationale                                                                       | Usage                                                                                    |
|----------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **`setConnectTimeout`**          | Sets the maximum time to establish a connection to the target server.             | Not explicitly set; defaults to system-level or infinite.         | Prevents the client from hanging indefinitely when the server is unreachable.   | Useful in high-availability systems to fail fast and retry or fallback.                  |
| **`setSocketTimeout`**           | Sets the maximum time to wait for data after the connection is established.       | Not explicitly set; defaults to system-level or infinite.         | Ensures that the client doesn't hang waiting for a slow or unresponsive server. | Critical for APIs where response time is important.                                      |
| **`setTimeToLive`**              | Sets the maximum lifespan of a persistent connection, regardless of activity.     | Not set by default (connections live indefinitely unless closed). | Prevents stale connections from being reused beyond a safe period.              | Helps avoid issues with long-lived connections in load balancers or proxies.             |
| **`setValidateAfterInactivity`** | Sets the period of inactivity after which a connection is validated before reuse. | Not set by default.                                               | Ensures idle connections are still valid before reuse, avoiding I/O errors.     | Important in environments with firewalls or proxies that silently drop idle connections. |

#### Socket Configuration Parameters

These settings operate at the TCP socket level, influencing how data is buffered, transmitted, and received.

| Configuration       | Purpose                                                     | Default       | Rationale                                                                                                    | Usage                                                                                  |
|---------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|---------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **`setRcvBufSize`** | Sets the size of the socket receive buffer (SO_RCVBUF).     | OS default    | Controls how much data can be buffered when receiving. Larger buffers help with high-throughput connections. | Tune for high-latency or high-bandwidth networks to avoid packet loss or throttling.   |
| **`setSoLinger`**   | Sets the linger time (SO_LINGER) for socket close behavior. | -1 (disabled) | Controls how long the socket will block on `close()` to ensure data is sent.                                 | Use with caution; can block threads. Useful when graceful shutdown of TCP is critical. |
| **`setSoTimeout`**  | Sets the socket read timeout (SO_TIMEOUT).                  | 0 (infinite)  | Prevents indefinite blocking when waiting for data.                                                          | Essential for responsiveness in real-time or user-facing applications.                 |
| **`setSndBufSize`** | Sets the size of the socket send buffer (SO_SNDBUF).        | OS default    | Controls how much data can be buffered when sending. Larger buffers help with bursty traffic.                | Tune for high-throughput uploads or streaming scenarios.                               |
| **`setTcpNoDelay`** | Enables/disables TCP_NODELAY (disables Nagleâ€™s algorithm).  | `true`        | Reduces latency by sending packets immediately without waiting to batch small messages.                      | Ideal for low-latency applications like chat, gaming, or real-time APIs.               |
